## 🚀 Features

### • Modular Engine  
FanTom’s backend is built around a clean service layer (`np_service`) that bridges legacy CLI commands into a modern, library‑style API.

### • Cinematic UI  
A polished, Hugging‑Face‑inspired interface (`index.html`, `style.css`) gives FanTom a unique identity—minimal, sharp, and unmistakably GhostTech.

### • Cross‑Platform Workflow  
Designed to run cleanly across:
- Android (Termux)
- Windows
- Linux environments  
All without breaking the architecture or introducing drift.

### • GhostTech Philosophy  
FanTom follows the GhostTech Delivery Protocol:
- Strict boundaries  
- Predictable modules  
- Zero creative drift in worker layers  
- Architect‑level control at all times
